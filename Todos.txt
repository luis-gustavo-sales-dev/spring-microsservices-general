  5.c - Create repositories, services and controllers for passwords groups.
  5.d - Create repositories, services and controllers for passwords logins.
  5.d - Create repositories, services and controllers for passwords infos.

 6 - Configure api-gateway to permit access for GeneratorPassword Project endpoints.
  6.a - Users can create a group password
  6.b - Users can create a login password

IMPORTANT: At the first look, classes about Password Login and Group have the same code. I think I should user inheritance or maybe refletion.
